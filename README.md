# AmpliconPE
Extracts DNA barcodes from Paired-End Amplicon Sequencing using Smith Waterman alignments

## Why use AmpliconPE for your barcoding project?

* Paried-end (redundant) seqencing of amplicons is cheaper and more accurate
* Homology-based alignment to a reference read is the most robust way to correct all read anomalies 
* AmpliconPE extracts both known barcodes (barcode sets) and random barcodes intelligently
* Its fast & simple
